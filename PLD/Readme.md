The GAL 16V8 handles the joysticks. The program is identical across all versions.

The GAL 20V8 handles address decoding. It is available in 3 versions:

- 20V8_16K: Limits the additional RAM to 16KB for the Alice 4K and Tandy MC10.

- 20V8_24K: Allows the maximum additional RAM (24KB) for the Alice 32.

- 20V8_20K: Special version for the Alice 4K and Tandy MC10 with an internal 8KB RAM extension. In this case, the additional RAM starts at $6000.

Note: In practice, it is possible to use the 24K version on the Alice 4K without any issues.
